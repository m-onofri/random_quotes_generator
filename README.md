# Random Quotes App

In this project I created an app that displays random quotes and random images abou dogs and cats.
This project is from the freeCodeCamp course and it's based on the React library.


## How to clone the app locally...

Clone the git repository in the folder of your choice:
```
git clone https://github.com/m-onofri/random_quotes_generator.git
```

Install the packages:
```
cd random_quotes_generator
npm install
```

Run the server:
```
npm start
```

In your browser, go to http://localhost:3000/, and play the game.


## ...or watch it live!

You can have a look at the app [here](https://m-onofri.github.io/random_quotes_generator/).


## Main features

* User can choose to see random images and random quotes about dogs or cats.
* The app displays quotes about dogs and cats from famous people.
* The images are from [thecatapi.com](https://thecatapi.com/) and from [thedogapi.com](https://thedogapi.com) and are randomly fetched from this APIs through AJAX wit Async/Await.


## Cross-browser consistency 

The project was checked on MacOS in Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Safari, and on these browsers it works properly.
